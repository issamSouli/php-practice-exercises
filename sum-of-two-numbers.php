<!--problem-2 :
** Create a new PHP file (for example, add.php).
** Inside the file, make two variables, $a and $b.
** Give them any whole-number values you like (for example, 7 and 5).
** Calculate the sum of those two numbers.
** Use echo to print a sentence that says what the two numbers are and what their sum is.
** It should look a bit like: “The sum of 7 and 5 is 12.” -->
<?php
$a = 7;
$b = 8;
$sum = $a + $b;
echo "The sum of $a and $b is $sum" ;
?>
