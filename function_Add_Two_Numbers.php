<!--
Write a function called addNumbers.

The function should take two parameters: $a and $b.

Inside the function, return the sum of $a and $b.

After defining the function, call it with any two numbers (like 3 and 7) and use echo to display the result. -->
<?php

function addNumbers($a, $b){
    return $a + $b;
}
echo "the sum is :" . addNumbers(25, 26);
