<!--
Make one variable called $number and set it to 1.

Write a while loop that runs while $number is less than or equal to 5.

Inside the loop, echo the value of $number followed by a space.

Then add 1 to $number.

When the loop finishes you should see: 1 2 3 4 5 ;
-->
<?php

$number = 1;

while( $number <= 5){
    echo $number . " ";
    $number++;
}
