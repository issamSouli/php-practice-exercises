** Add a new key "foot" with the value "Right" or "Left" (foot preference).
** Increase the "goals" by 10 (simulate a scoring streak).
** Use unset() to remove the "age" key.
** Use count() to find how many properties the player has now.
** Use echo to display this sentence:
ðŸ‘‰ "[name] plays as a [position] for [club] and has scored [goals] goals."
** Use print_r($player); to show the final array.
